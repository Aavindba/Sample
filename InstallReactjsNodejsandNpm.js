Nodejs/*Node.js is a platform built on  Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine for easily building fast and scalable network applications. 
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, 
perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.*/

Npm /*npm , short for Node Package Manager, is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository 
for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting 
with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

npm is the package manager for JavaScript and the world’s largest software registry. 
Discover packages of reusable code — and assemble them in powerful new ways.*/
